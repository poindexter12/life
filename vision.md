My vision is to be a mindful and present pillar of my family, giving more than I take. I want to be have a healthy and active body and mind, continually exercising those every day. I want to be well read, able to surf, capable at fishing, and continue to excel at software development. I want to be financially stable, saving for my children's college education, retirement for Jill and I, and paying off my house as quickly as possible. I would like to travel to Alaska, Canada, Scandinavia, Tahiti and the Virgin Islands. I hope to have a house by the beach or a house by a lake.
